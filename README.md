# spillwayFlow
spillwayFlow is a solver developed to predict aerated flow on a spillway. The
solver adds an air entrainment model on top of OpenFOAM's VoF solver interFoam.

## Compatibility:
spillwayFlow is known to work on OpenFOAM version 5.


## Installation:

0.  Source your OpenFOAM environment, e.g.:

    	    source /home/$USER/OpenFOAM/OpenFOAM-5/etc/bashrc

1.  In a linux terminal download the package with git by typing:

       	    git clone https://github.com/siljekre/spillwayFlow

2.  Execute the Allwmake script by typing

            cd spillwayFlow
            ./Allwmake
